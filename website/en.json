		"policy": "<b>I</b>nternet privacy is a right. Why should we accept that we wouldn't accept in our daily life (offline) ? For many years, private companies such as Google, Facebook, etc... as well as government agencies spy on us to gather informations about us everyday on the web. However, we are able to counter this mass spying using cryptography but too few projects allow us to protect us properly. But today, we are fortunate to have a safe alternative for our mails: <span>ProtonMail</span>, which allows encryption end-to-end thereof.<br /><b>I</b>t's in that perspective that we launched the development of Quanta Cloud, to offer an alternative for storing securely your documents online. Our policy requires us to encrypt end-to-end files making you the only true owner thereof.",
