### Before translating

Copy en.json or fr.json, or the .json you prefere in the language
you want to translate.

Example : I'm french, I know very well the French language, and i
want to translate in Spanish.

So, I copy fr.json in es.json, and I start to translate.


### Framework

```json
"global": {
"home": "Encrypt your files",
"about": "About",
"adventure": "Achievement",
"security": "Security",
"blog": "Blog",
"donate": "Donate",
"help": "Help",
"login": "Login",
"register": "Register",
"close": "Close"
},

```
Here, we see that "global" is the "category", it is used in the code to identify which "category" we'll use. (DO NOT OVERWIRTE)

"home" is the "id" of the translation text, it is used in the code to identify which text we'll display. (DO NOT OVERWIRTE)

"Encrypt your files" is the translation text, it's what you need to translate. (You can overwrite)
